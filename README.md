📝 Approach Summary

The ShopSpeak 🛒🎤 Voice Command Shopping Assistant was developed as an interactive and multilingual shopping assistant. The project leverages React (Vite) for a modern, responsive interface and integrates speech recognition APIs for voice input. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is implemented to process user commands like “Add 2 apples” or “Remove milk”, with support for multiple languages including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Gujarati.

The system offers Smart Suggestions based on shopping history, seasonal trends, and substitutes (e.g., suggesting almond milk if regular milk is unavailable). A categorized Grocery Section allows quick manual selection of items. Items in the shopping list can be managed with quantity controls, category grouping, and a clear-all option.

The UI was designed with a vibrant blue–pink–yellow theme, offering both light and dark modes, with user preference saved for persistence. Animations, icons, and a clean tile-based layout were used to make the interface engaging and modern.

Deployment was done using Vercel (for hosting) and GitHub (for version control and collaboration). This ensures accessibility via a working URL and transparent source code submission. The application fulfills all deliverables and provides a user-friendly, voice-powered shopping experience.
